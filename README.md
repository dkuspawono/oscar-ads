### Oscar ads

This directory contains data behind the story [Hollywood Studios  Barely Promote Non-White Actors and Films](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/oscars-diversity-hollywood-ad-campaign).

This is an inventory of "For Your Consideration" advertisements placed in Variety and The Hollywood Reporter from the beginning of November 2015 through the last issue published before the 2016 Academy Awards nomination voting deadline. 

The folder `oscar_campaign_project` contains sequential photographs of each of the advertisments listed here, for the benefit of future analysis regarding uncoded things. (THR stands for The Hollywood Reporter.)

We mainly look at aggregate ad placement. Still, a further analysis coding each advertisement based on what awards they specifically asked to be considered for or who was highlighted in each advertisement could be a fruitful avenue of research.
